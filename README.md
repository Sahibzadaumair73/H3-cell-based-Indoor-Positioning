The Proposed scheme is evaluated on the dataset using WiFi RSS measurements collected on the 3rd and 5th floor of the library environment of Unviersitat Jaume I in Spain. The total area of both floors is about 308.4m2. Samples were collected by a trained person using Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone over the span of 25 months. During the first month, 15 offline datasets were collected and we utilized them to train our model. The model performance is evaluated on the databases that were collected during the whole 25 months. Each floor contains 24 reference 218
points and 106 test points.
